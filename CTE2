Here is another example where I have created a list of the top customers based on the list from CTE1, separeted by the countries with most customers.

WITH top_5_customer_cte 
        AS (SELECT  A.customer_id, 
                    A.first_name, 
                    A.last_name, 
                    D. country_id, 
                    C.city, 
                    SUM(E.amount) AS total_spent 
FROM payment E 
INNER JOIN customer A ON E.customer_id=A.customer_id 
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id 
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id 
WHERE C.city IN ('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei','So Leopoldo','Teboksary','Tianjin','Cianjur') 
GROUP BY A.customer_id, D.country_id, C.city 
ORDER BY total_spent DESC LIMIT 5), 
all_customer_count_cte AS(SELECT D.country,
COUNT (DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count 
FROM customer A 
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id 
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id 
GROUP BY D.country) 
SELECT D.country, 
            COUNT (DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count, 
            COUNT (DISTINCT top_5_customer_cte.customer_id) AS top_customer_count 
FROM customer A 
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id 
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id 
LEFT JOIN top_5_customer_cte ON D.country_id = top_5_customer_cte.country_id 
GROUP BY D.country 
ORDER BY top_customer_count 
DESC LIMIT 5;
